# Scatterplot Graph Visualization

This project is a Scatterplot Graph visualization inspired by FreeCodeCamp's Scatterplot Graph challenge. It was built with a focus on fulfilling specific user stories to ensure functional completeness and visual clarity.

## Project Overview
The app includes a scatterplot graph that dynamically represents cyclist performance data. It uses D3.js to create an SVG-based visualization, complete with interactive tooltips, axes, and a legend for enhanced user experience.

## Features
- **Interactive Tooltip**: Displays additional information (e.g., year, time) when hovering over data points.
- **Dynamic Axis Generation**: Automatically generates tick marks and labels based on the dataset.
- **Legend**: Provides an intuitive description of data categories.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures optimal viewing across various devices.
- **Clear Visualization**: Highlights trends and outliers in the dataset.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the web application.
- **CSS**: Styling for the graph and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Core functionality and interactivity.
- **D3.js**: Visualization library for creating the scatterplot and managing data-driven elements.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from FreeCodeCamp:
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/cyclist-data.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/cyclist-data.json)

The data contains information about cyclist performance, including year, time, and doping allegations.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

### Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Interact with the scatterplot graph and verify its functionality.

## Usage
- Hover over a data point to see a tooltip with detailed information.
- Observe how the axes dynamically adjust to the dataset range.
- Interpret trends and categories using the provided legend.

## Dependencies
- **D3.js**: For SVG-based data visualization.

## Credits
This Scatterplot Graph project is part of the FreeCodeCamp Data Visualization Certification course. It was completed as one of the required projects in the curriculum.

FreeCodeCamp (FCC) is a nonprofit organization that offers a comprehensive web development curriculum and certifications. The Data Visualization Certification focuses on creating meaningful visual representations of data using libraries like D3.js. It covers various topics including data manipulation, design principles, and interactivity.
